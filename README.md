# basic-blackjack

This is the first project ive completed with no guide or video for help. its very basic.
There are 1's and 11's in the deck (can't select between the two), it doesnt have a betting mechanism, but still has the basic concepts of the game.
There are many things I can look to improve on when my knowledge gets better!
hope you enjoy.

To play:
Run the program.
Read your card total and select if you want another card (h), or if you want to stay (s).
You may continue to hit (h) until you've gotten as close to 21 as possible (without going over of course).
Select stay (s) when youve reached your number, if you are over 21, select stay (s) to get results and end the session.
