# basic-blackjack

this is just the first project ive completed with no guide or video for help. its very basic.
there are 1's and 11's in the deck, there isn't a 4x chance of hitting a 10 like a regualr deck, and it doesnt tally wins or have a betting mechanism.
All things i can look to improve on when my knowledge gets better!
hope you enjoy.
